== Description ==
The plugin adds DEFAULT Profile and Group cover settings in WP Admin - Settings - BuddyPress - Settings.

Updated to work with BuddyPress 2.4. Added an option to replace functionality of BuddyPress 2.4
The default image settings works with BuddyPress 2.4 core functionality.
Since the cover functionality is included in Buddypress core since version 2.4, right now having the plugin active will use BP functionality and use the old uploaded image until you upload a new one with the new BP interface.
The plugins screens are no longer used if you have BuddyPress greater than 2.4
